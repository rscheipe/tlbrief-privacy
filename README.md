# TL;Brief Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: February 13, 2026**

## Overview

TL;Brief ("the Extension") is a browser extension that summarizes web page content using AI. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about how data is handled.

## Data Collection

### What We Collect
**Nothing.** TL;Brief does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to our servers. We do not have servers.

### What Stays on Your Device
- **OpenAI API Key**: Stored locally in your browser's extension storage (`chrome.storage.local`). Never transmitted to anyone except OpenAI when making summary requests.
- **Usage Counter**: A daily count of summaries used, stored locally. Resets each day.
- **Settings**: Your preferences (model selection, summary length) stored locally.

### What Is Sent to OpenAI
When you click "Summarize This Page," the text content of the current web page is sent to OpenAI's API using your personal API key. This is a direct connection between your browser and OpenAI's servers. TL;Brief does not proxy, intercept, log, or store this data.

OpenAI's handling of this data is governed by [OpenAI's Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy/) and [API Data Usage Policy](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies).

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data with third parties because we do not collect any data.

## Permissions

TL;Brief requests the following Chrome permissions:

- **activeTab**: To read the content of the page you're currently viewing when you click "Summarize."
- **storage**: To save your API key, settings, and usage counter locally.
- **scripting**: To extract text content from web pages for summarization.

These permissions are used solely for the Extension's core functionality.

## Children's Privacy

TL;Brief is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above.
